        "~ Python is a programming language. It is popular becuase it is easy to learn and use, versatile, large community and have good ecosystem of libraries.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.What is an interpreter in Python ?\n",
        "~ An interpreter in Python is a program that reads and executes Python code line by line, converting it into machine code that your computer can understand and run.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.What are pre-defined keywords in Python ?\n",
        "~ Pre-defined keywords in Python are special reserved words that have a fixed meaning. You can not use them as names for variables or functions. e.g. if, else, True, False etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.Can keywords be used as variable names ?\n",
        "~ No, keywords cannot be used as variable names.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.What is mutability in Python ?\n",
        "~ Objects/container whose state or value can be changed after they are created is called mutable in python and the concept is called mutability.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable ?\n",
        "~ Lists are mutable and tuples are immutable because:\n",
        "  >Lists are made to store data that can change. That is why Python allows\n",
        "   you to modify, add, or remove items in a list.\n",
        "  >Tuples are made to store fixed data. Python locks their contents so\n",
        "   they can’t be changed, which makes them safer and faster to use, especially when used as keys in dictionaries.\n",

        "~ \"is\" is identity operator, \"==\" is equality operator.  \n",

        "8.What are logical operators in Python ?\n",
        "~ Logical operators in Python are used to combine multiple conditions (True or False values).\n",

        "9.What is type casting in Python ?\n",
        "~ Type casting in Python means converting one data type into another.\n",

        "10.What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting ?\n",
        "~ The difference between implicit and explicit type casting in Python is:\n",
        " >Implicit Type Casting - Python automatically converts one data type to another without your help.\n",
        " >Explicit Type Casting - You manually convert the data type using functions like int(), float(), str(), etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "11.What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python ?\n",
        "~ The purpose of conditional statements in Python is to control the flow of your program by making decisions based on conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "12.How does the elif statement work ?\n",
        "~ How it works:\n",
        "  Python checks the if condition first.\n",
        "  If if is False, it checks the elif.\n",
        "  If elif is True, that block runs and the rest are skipped.\n",
        "  If all are False, the else block runs (if present).\n",
